A simple HTML project demonstrating basic concepts

# My HTML Learning Journey

This repository contains my very first HTML project, designed to showcase basic concepts I've learned. It's a simple, unstyled web page focused purely on HTML structure.

## Concepts Covered:

* HTML Boilerplate (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
* Nesting and Indenting
* HTML Headings (`<h1>` through `<h6>`)
* HTML Paragraphs (`<p>`)
* HTML Lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`)
* HTML Comments (`<!-- ... -->`)

## How to View:

You can clone this repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Room for Enhancement:

As I continue my web development journey, I plan to enhance this project with:

* Basic CSS styling
* Adding images and links
* Creating forms and tables
* Introducing JavaScript interactivity
* Implementing responsive design
